As of now, we are changing the $m$ and $b$ variables by at least the sum of all of the errors based upon our line's predictions relative to our actual data.  Our line would change drastically at every iteration through the formulas.  We need to apply a learning rate to each of these partial derivates to ensure that we avoid drastically updating our regression line with each step.  As we have seen before, the learning rate is just a small number, like $.0001$ which controls the amount with which we update the regression line.  The learning rate is  represented by the Greek letters eta, $\\eta$, or alpha $\\alpha$.  We'll use eta, so $\\eta = .0001$ means that our learning rate is $.0001$.\n",

Applying a learning rate to scale down changes to our regression line works fine, as long as the proportion and direction of the move remains the same.  While were at it, we need not multiply our partials by 2.  Again, we're in good shape so long as our changes are proportional."
